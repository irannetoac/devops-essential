## Terraform IaaC

the files are inside terraform folder in root directory

I was able to describe the ec2 and rds instance through terraform (main.tf). That's is my main accomplish.

outputs.tf is an attempt of use terraform resource provisioned variables to use into the application itself
setup.sh is an attempt to automate the application running through terraform
